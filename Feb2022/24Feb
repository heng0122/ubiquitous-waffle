I'm still doing the IAMM poster, and now "researching" on music research in Singapore. 

And actually Prof Kat has done quite a lot of research and efforts since 2018. Hmm in 2018, oh I went to Europe hahah I wonder why I didn't look up much research in Singapore, but always look at stuff overseas.
