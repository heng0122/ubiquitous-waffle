Hello waffle!

Here is an attempt to document things I learn everyday. :D

Yesterday I learnt that Scopus and PsycINFO database search need institutional access. 
There was something cool about Scopus - it can show you research by region. Which would be very helpful in searching all the music research done in Singapore! Rather than I un-systematically google scholar things. 

Today I came across some papers that say:
Systematic review, but no paper search: (2015) The pleasures of sad music - a systematic review [no methods]
Integrative review, but no paper search: (2018) An integrative review of the enjoyment of sadness associated with music [no methods]
